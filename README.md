This code creates a simple weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure features an input field for users to enter a location, a button to fetch weather data, and a display area for showing the results. CSS styles give the app a clean and user-friendly appearance with a centered layout. The JavaScript interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather information based on the user's input. When the button is clicked, it fetches weather data, checks for errors (like city not found), and displays the temperature and weather conditions in a formatted manner. Overall, the code combines frontend design with API integration to provide a functional weather application.
